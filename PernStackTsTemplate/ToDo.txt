inspired by Spotify layout?

Create a now playing context, click on a play button on the track to update the global now playing state, 
Create a playbar footer with playback controls, next song, previous song, volume, 
Create a sidebar with playlists, recently played, or whatever
Make each AlbumItem/Music item a button that takes you to the album or playlists
Create Album page with tracks, play buttons on each track etc.
Settings menu

Design a layout and create the tailwind
Keep on with context API but later migrate it over the Zustand


WORK ON BACK END, MAKE SURE EACH APPLE ACCOUNT IS HOOKED UP TO ONLY ITS INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT, ETC

when you switch albums you can have different songs playing at the same time - maybe something to do with the musicInstance? maybe I need a reset function that sets state to null that I call in the play function if anything different is already playing
musicplayer state management - 
-now playing
-up next
-current playlist
-timeline
-volume


-search page & result display: recent searches, combine artist album, song, playlist, podcast searches together into one page?
-artist display page (page you go to when you click on artist name) - top albums, top songs, featured playlists etc
-build out sidebar with song history/playlists
-create stack concept - pair up to 10 albums together to make a stack - maybe use the 3d js library to animate the stacks

-work on the loading issues (have the middle of the site change without effecting the sidebar etc)


**fix bug where if two of the same song on playlist they both get highlighted in playlist view when playing (filter by trackId?)

**need to set certain global variables when user signs up, settings page where these can be changed:
country code
bitrate
load library

log out button

----artist page---

---playlists in the sidebar---


**add search hints in a modal that dropdown as you type - select one and it sets that as the search term/executes searches

**fix issue on library page of making sure only the album playing changes to the play sign

one work around for loading artist page for library albums is to link them to the search page with the url param of the artist name?
