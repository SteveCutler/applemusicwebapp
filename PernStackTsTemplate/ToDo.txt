inspired by Spotify layout?

Create a now playing context, click on a play button on the track to update the global now playing state, 
Create a playbar footer with playback controls, next song, previous song, volume, 
Create a sidebar with playlists, recently played, or whatever
Make each AlbumItem/Music item a button that takes you to the album or playlists
Create Album page with tracks, play buttons on each track etc.
Settings menu

Design a layout and create the tailwind
Keep on with context API but later migrate it over the Zustand


WORK ON BACK END, MAKE SURE EACH APPLE ACCOUNT IS HOOKED UP TO ONLY ITS INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT, ETC

when you switch albums you can have different songs playing at the same time - maybe something to do with the musicInstance? maybe I need a reset function that sets state to null that I call in the play function if anything different is already playing
musicplayer state management - 
-now playing
-up next
-current playlist
-timeline
-volume
