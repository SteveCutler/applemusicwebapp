Investigate the itunes library api provides a lot better datapoints for library images, playcounts, last play date etc, all this can be used to create recommendations from library (first I could just cycle through recommending albums or songs that have been played a lot by user, could also recommend things that have a lot of plays but the latest play date is not for a while, a 'Jump back in' recommmendation)
itunes library api only works in desktop app context - nevermind.

-add loading animations to EVERYTHING
-when you log in you have to refresh for musickit to load
I should probably switch all musickit calls to back end for security?
add to queue
add route to add private podcast rss feed to subscription

using start and the hardware playback buttons to control playback
library albums artwork not updating properly

issue playing library albums from sidebar
fix sizing of single objects on search page

figure out best way of importing library to database - handle on frontend or backend?



Major problems:
artist page

Song page api calls?


create settings page and data for the user - defaults on signup, etc.
various musicplayer options, location, syncing library options, dark mode

add to queue/ play next functionality on modal

add api calls to stations & songs pages 

redesign toast

add drag and drop feature to playlist creation



THINGS TO FOCUS ON
add feature for users to follow artist - checks if they have anything new and displays on homepage
Create stacks functionality (playlist composed of multiple albumIds)

pull more historical data and do something interesting with that.
work on search page - design, search hints, etc
create a settings page

investigate adding friends?


like/follow artist
ACTIVITY Page, most recently followed artists, top release or recent releases from them, recent liked songs, recent liked albums


things open up in the middle area
WHAT I NEED TO DO BEFORE I CAN LAUNCH
add more datapoints to homepage (make sure I have all of them)



-create stack concept - pair up to 10 albums together to make a stack - maybe use the 3d js library to animate the stacks





log out button


**add search hints in a modal that dropdown as you type - select one and it sets that as the search term/executes searches
**fix issue on library page of making sure only the album playing changes to the play sign

add default image for artist, song playlist etc

----



** add display for album image in the 'more like this album' display bar

** make sure the song history updates every time a song finishes and add a cool bubble animation where the new song pops in

** sort playlists by most recently played




follow artist?


add different display options for library (artist, album, song, genre?)

** create playlist, add to playlist etc.

** add functionality to playlist play buttons on homepage (if type === playlists or something)

FEATURE IDEAS:
-recommendations based on heavy rotation albums
-wayback playback: pick a time in history and highlight your top albums of the time
-in general get the historical plays information and do some interesting things with it
-suggested playlist based on library listens
-when the new mix drops make it a feature at the top of the page for the first day
