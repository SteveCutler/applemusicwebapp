Investigate the itunes library api provides a lot better datapoints for library images, playcounts, last play date etc, all this can be used to create recommendations from library (first I could just cycle through recommending albums or songs that have been played a lot by user, could also recommend things that have a lot of plays but the latest play date is not for a while, a 'Jump back in' recommmendation)
itunes library api only works in desktop app context - nevermind.
