Investigate the itunes library api provides a lot better datapoints for library images, playcounts, last play date etc, all this can be used to create recommendations from library (first I could just cycle through recommending albums or songs that have been played a lot by user, could also recommend things that have a lot of plays but the latest play date is not for a while, a 'Jump back in' recommmendation)
itunes library api only works in desktop app context - nevermind.

-OPTIMIZE - are there profiling tools for this?
-redesign track display
-make all the areas scroll seperately
-add autoplay feature to podcasts?
-add loading animations to EVERYTHING
-when you log in you have to refresh for musickit to load
-I should probably switch all musickit calls to back end for security?
-add to queue/play next feature in modal
-add route to add private podcast rss feed to subscriptions
-investigate if theres a way to add podcast recommendations
-using start and the hardware playback buttons to control playback
-add sorting functionality to library? - sort by albumName, artistName etc? list view?
-add feature that transitions between night and dark mode gradually over time based on timezone
-search page needs to be seriously optimized
-library page needs work especially rows. should I try to emulate old itunes display?
    >sorting options for album title, artist name, genre, etc
-fix sizing of single objects on search page
-change endpoint for most recent podcasts to use the podcastapi recent episodes endpoint
-figure out whats going on with storefront code generation - how to create and save it automatically?

-do more work on settings page: add dark mode settings, bitrate options, dark mode

-redesign toast/figure out when is appropriate to display them
-add drag and drop feature to playlist creation
work on search page - design, search hints, etc
**add search hints in a search page that dropdown as you type - select one and it sets that as the search term/executes searches

add different display options for library (artist, album, song, genre?)
-perfect 'play to pause' symbol, play/pause handler fuctionality
-move music kit calls to backend?
-redesign play/options buttons
-add favourites functionality
-add account email verification? password changing mechanics
-handle auth data

-auth issues:
    make sure token retrieval and saving is working as expected
    investigate why refresh is necessary after logging in
    





add feature for users to follow artist - checks if they have anything new and displays on homepage
pull more historical data and do something interesting with that.
investigate adding friends?
-create stack concept - pair up to 10 albums together to make a stack - maybe use the 3d js library to animate the stacks
add default image for artist, song playlist etc
** create playlist, add to playlist etc.
** add functionality to playlist play buttons on homepage (if type === playlists or something)
-recommendations based on heavy rotation albums
-wayback playback: pick a time in history and highlight your top albums of the time
